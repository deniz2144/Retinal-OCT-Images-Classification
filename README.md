# Retinal OCT Images Classification
  This project uses a deep learning model to classify retina OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images. The model is built on the basis of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow libraries


This project uses a deep learning model to classify retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images. The project consists of two main parts: training the model and making predictions on new images.

Model Training and Evaluation Code:

File: train_and_evaluate_model.py
Defines, trains, and evaluates a CNN model. Includes code for visualizing training accuracy and loss.
